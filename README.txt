CONTENTSThis is the native system level patch version 71J059 for the US MessagePad2100. The patch contains a fix for the Newton's 2010 problem, as well as thecontents of the original 717260 patch.The files in this patch are: * Patch.pkg - the actual patch. * Y2010 Diagnostic.pkg - a diagosis tool for the Y2010 problem. * 717260 Install Override.pkg - the original 717260 patch, modified to   install over any existing patch, not used except for troubleshooting.COMPATIBILITYThis patch only works on the US MessagePad 2100. Do not install it on anyother model!INSTALLATIONThe patch is installed like any other Newton package, e.g. using NCU, NCX orany other installation tool. After installation, the Newton prompts for areboot. After the reboot, the Newton OS patch level is updated to 71J059.The recommended installation steps are: 1. Create a backup of the Newton 2. Install the Y2010 Diagnostic.pkg file 3. Install the Patch.pkg file and reboot the Newton 4. Launch the Y2010 Diagnostic tool and check whether the times for scheduled    alarms are sensibleThe patch process does not modify or delete any data (such as a brain wipe),and the Newton is ready to be used after the patch was applied.TROUBLESHOOTINGIF THE NEWTON FAILS TO REBOOT AFTER PATCH INSTALLATION, PLEASE CONTACT<support@40hz.org> IMMEDIATELY! The actual patch process is very sensitive andcan only be reverted by replacing the ROM board with a board from a GermanMessagePad 2100 or an eMate.If the Newton shows strange behaviour related to alarms and other time relatedfunctions, please contact <support@40hz.org>, or revert to the original systemversion using the 717260 Install Override.pkg.If the Newton enters an endless alarm loop, it is possible to clear all alarmsusing the Y2010 Diagnostic application. Alarms have to be re-entered manuallyafterwards.
